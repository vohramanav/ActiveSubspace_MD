\section{Background}
\label{sec:bg}

In this section, we provide relevant details pertaining to the NEMD simulation 
in~\ref{sub:nemd}, and key theoretical aspects of the active subspace methodology 
in~\ref{sub:as}.

\subsection{NEMD simulation}
\label{sub:nemd}

The NEMD simulations in this work were performed using the LAMMPS software~\cite{Plimpton:2007}.
Specifically, the simulations were performed for a Si bar of length, $L$, subjected to a temperature gradient, 
$\left(\frac{dT}{dz}\right)$. The temperature gradient was applied by means of Langevin thermostats located
at $L/4$ and $3L/4$. Schematic illustration of the set-up and the arrangement of atoms is provided below in 
Figure~\ref{fig:setup}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The heat flux between the thermostats at the end of the simulation ($q$, W/m$^2$) is recorded to compute the
thermal conductivity of the Si bar using Fourier's law:
%
\be
 \kappa = \frac{q}{\left|\frac{dT}{dz}\right|} 
\ee
%
where $\left|\frac{dT}{dz}\right|$ denotes the magnitude of the applied thermal gradient. In Table~\ref{tab:input},
we provide the set of inputs used to perform the NEMD simulation. Note that the simulation run length, width, 
and height were selected to minimize temperature fluctuations during the different stages of the simulation while
ensuring a reasonable computational effort.

As illustrated in the following flow diagram, there are four stages involved in the NEMD simulation: 
NPT, NVT, NVE (I), and
NVE (II); NPT, NVT and NVE are thermodynamic ensembles used commonly in NEMD simulations. We have used
(I) and (II) here to distinguish between the two NVE ensembles.

%
In the first stage, an NPT ensemble was run for a sufficiently long time to to ensure that the 
system attains a steady value of the bar length, as discussed in~\cite{Vohra:2018a}.
During the NVT stage, the system is equilibrated to a specific bulk temperature at which the thermal
conductivity of the bar is to be estimated. The NVE (I) stage involves equilibration of the thermostats
at specified temperatures. Lastly, during the NVE (II) stage, the trajectory of individual atoms during
simulation is recorded.

\subsection{Active Subspace}
\label{sub:as}

As mentioned earlier in section~\ref{sec:intro}, the active subspace is a low-dimensional space in the
input domain that sufficiently captures the variability in the QoI~\cite{Constantine:2015}.
Uncertain model inputs, $\bm{\theta}$, are parameterized as canonical random variables, 
$\bm{\xi}\in\Omega\in\mathbb{R}^{N_\theta}$, where $N_{\theta}$ denotes the number of uncertain inputs. 
Pseudorandom samples are generated according the joint probability distribution of $\xi_i$'s ($\pi_\vec\xi$).
The samples are then projected back to the physical space to evaluate the model output, $G$. The
active subspace is spanned by the dominant eigenvectors of a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix,
$\mat{C}$:
%
\be
\mat{C} = \int_\Omega (\nabla_{\vec{\xi}}G)(\nabla_{\vec{\xi}}G)^\top dP_\vec\xi, 
\label{eq:C}
\ee
%  
where $dP_\vec\xi$ = $\pi_\vec\xi d\vec\xi$. Note that $G$ is assumed to be 
differentiable in the considered
input domain. Additionally, $G$ and its partial derivatives in~\eqref{eq:C} are assumed to be 
L$^2$ integrable. Consider the eigenvalue decomposition of $\mat{C}$:
%
\be
\mat{C} = \mat{W}\mat{\Lambda}\mat{W}^\top.
\ee
%
where $\mat{\Lambda}$ = diag($\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_\Nt$) with $\lambda_i$'s sorted in
descending order:
\[
     \lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_\Nt \geq 0.
\] 
%
The matrix, $\mat{W}$ comprises orthonormal eigenvectors as its columns. The eigenpairs are partitioned
about the $p^{th}$ eigenvalue such that, \scalebox{1.25}{$\left(\frac{\lambda_p}{\lambda_{p+1}}\right)$}$\gg 1$
as follows:
%
\be
 \mat{W} = [\mat{W}_1~\mat{W}_2],~~\mat{\Lambda} = \begin{bmatrix}\mat{\Lambda}_1 & \\  &
  \mat{\Lambda}_2. 
\end{bmatrix}
\ee
%
The column space of $\mat{W}_1$ constitutes the dominant eigenspace of $\mat{C}$, regarded as the
active subspace, and $\mat{\Lambda}_1$ is the corresponding diagonal matrix with 
$\{\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_p\}$ as its entries. Dimension reduction is accomplished by transforming the
model output, $G(\vec\xi)$ (a function of $\Nt$ independent inputs) into $\mathcal{Y}(\vec\eta)$, a
function of $p$ independent inputs, where $\vec\eta$ = $\mat{W}_1^\top \vec\xi\in\mathbb{R}^p$, 
is referred to as the set of \textit{active variables}. Computational effort associated with UQ
is hence reduced by means of dimension reduction. In practice, the matrix, $\mat{C}$ is numerically approximated using model gradient estimates at random samples
in the input space as follows:
 %
 \be
 \mat{C}\approx \hat{\mat{C}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} 
 (\nabla_{\vec{\xi}}G(\vec{\xi}_i))(\nabla_{\vec{\xi}}G(\vec{\xi}_i))^\top
 = \hat{\mat{W}}\hat{\mat{\Lambda}}\hat{\mat{W}}^\top.
\label{eq:chat}
 \ee
 %
Hence, the computational effort required for constructing $\hat{\mat{C}}$ scales with the number of samples, $N$.
To avoid excessive number of model evaluations and hence optimize the computational effort, a regression-based
approach for gradient estimation is employed to compute the active subspace
in an iterative manner as discussed in~\ref{sub:gradient} and~\ref{sub:subspace}. The
active subspace could be exploited to perform a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of the SW parameters as discussed in~\ref{sub:scores}, and efficient Bayesian calibration as discussed
in~\ref{sub:ba_method}.
