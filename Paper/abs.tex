\section*{Abstract}
Bulk phonon transport in silicon (Si) is commonly investigated using the
Stillinger-Weber (SW) interatomic potential in non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics (NEMD). Nominal estimates
of the SW parameters, however, are based on a limited search
using a sparse set of measurements and constrained by structural stability
of the considered system in~\cite{Stillinger:1985}. It is therefore
critical to study the impact of uncertainty associated with nominal
parameter values on bulk phonon transport using NEMD. 
However, the analysis typically requires tens of thousands of model evaluations
and hence, relying purely on atomistic simulations would be impractical.
In this work, we focus on an efficient approach for propagating the 
uncertainty from SW parameters
to bulk thermal conductivity estimates using NEMD simulations of a Si bar.
Computational effort is minimized by reducing the
dimensionality of the input space by computing the so-called active subspace.
Active subspace computation, however, requires gradient information of
the model output with respect to the uncertain inputs which can be
computationally challenging. To overcome this challenge, we estimate the
gradient using a linear regression fit to the available set of
model evaluations as opposed to a perturbation-based gradient estimation
(e.g. finite difference, adjoint-based methods etc.) 
that would require additional model runs. Moreover, 
we employ an iterative strategy to avoid unnecessary computations once
a converged active subspace is obtained.
The active subspace thus computed in an efficient manner is found to be
1-dimensional, indicating enormous scope for dimension as well as
associated computational effort reduction. A surrogate model is 
then built in the 1-dimensional subspace to help quantify
the variability of the bulk thermal conductivity, and is shown to have
reasonable accuracy. Finally, the
active subspace is used to perform efficient global sensitivity analysis (GSA)
of the SW parameters.
