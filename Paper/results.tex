\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, we present our findings based on the implementation of the efficient computational framework 
presented earlier in Section~\ref{sec:method}, for identifying an active subspace that captures the variability
in bulk thermal conductivity of Si due to uncertainty in the SW potential parameters. As discussed earlier, the
active subspace helps transform the dependence of the model output, $G$ on a large set of uncertain physical
inputs into an equivalent function, $\mathcal{Y}$ in the active subspace. Note that dimension reduction is
accomplished since $\mathcal{Y}$ depends on a much smaller set of independent variables, $\vec\eta$,
referred to as active variables. While dimension reduction increases computational efficiency, it could be enhanced
by means of a regression fit to the trend exhibited by $\mathcal{Y}(\vec{\eta})$. Since the active subspace is
observed to be 1-dimensional in the present case, we used a linear regression fit to $\mathcal{Y}(\vec{\eta})$
to construct a surrogate, $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}(\vec{\eta})$.
The accuracy of the surrogate was assessed by first evaluating the 
relative L-2 norm of the discrepancy between NEMD-based estimates and surrogate predictions,
and second, by comparing probability distributions of the bulk thermal conductivity as obtained using
model evaluations, and the surrogate. The surrogate was exploited to perform a GSA of the SW
potential parameters using the two approaches discussed in~\ref{sub:scores}.

\subsection{Computing the active subspace}
\label{sub:cas}

The iterative procedure outlined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:free} was used to compute the active subspace. 
We began
with an initial set of 5 samples in the 7-dimensional input space. The Monte Carlo samples were drawn
from the joint probability distribution of the uncertain SW parameters, considered
to be uniformly distributed in the interval $[0.9\theta_i^\ast,1.1\theta_i^\ast]$, where $\theta_i^\ast$ are the
nominal values provided in Table~\ref{tab:sw}.

$A$ & $B$ & $p$ & $q$ & $\alpha$ & $\lambda$ & $\gamma$ \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Nominal values of the SW potential parameters~\cite{Stillinger:1985}.}
\label{tab:sw}
\end{table}
%
An initial set of model evaluations was used to estimate the gradient vector of thermal conductivity with
individual components representing the derivative with respect to $\xi_i$ corresponding to $\theta_i$ in
the physical space. At each iteration, $i$, model evaluations at 5 new samples in the full space were 
obtained and the quantity, $\vec{\varepsilon}^{(i)}$ was computed using~\eqref{eq:conv}. The iterative
procedure was terminated once the highest component of $\vec{\varepsilon}^{(i)}$ was found to be smaller than
the set tolerance, $\tau$ = 0.1. In this case, the process was observed to converge after 4 iterations,
and required model evaluations at 25 samples, yielding $\max(\vec{\varepsilon}^{(i)})$~=~0.085.
 The resulting active subspace was found to be
1-dimensional. In Figure~\ref{fig:casfig1}, we plot the components of the dominant eigenvector (left),
and the quantity, $\max(\vec{\varepsilon}^{(i)})$, computed using components of the dominant eigenvector 
obtained between successive iterations, $i$ and $i-1$ (right) in~\eqref{eq:conv}.

active subspace. Right: A plot of $\max(\varepsilon^{(i)})$, obtained

\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

The normalized eigenvalue spectrum is illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:casfig2}~(left), and the plot of $\mathcal{Y}$ vs. $\vec\eta$, regarded as the \textit{sufficient
summary plot} (SSP) is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:casfig2}~(right). Note that the surrogate $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}$
represented by the straight-line is also illustrated.

\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
The normalized eigenvalue spectrum
shows that the ratio of the first two eigenvalues, $\left(\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}\right)\sim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$.
Thus, the second largest eigenvalue is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the largest eigenvalue,
indicating a 1-dimensional active subspace. Furthermore, the trends in the SSP seem to have been captured
reasonably well using a linear regression fit which further confirms the existence of a 1-dimensional active
subspace in this case. In the following section, we verify the accuracy of the
surrogate, $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}$. 


\subsection{Surrogate assessment}
\label{sub:ver}

The surrogate, $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}$, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:casfig2}~(right) 
is assessed for accuracy at two levels: First, we perform a low-level assessment by estimating
 the relative L-2 norm of the difference
($\varepsilon_d$) between surrogate predictions and NEMD-based estimates of bulk thermal conductivity 
of the Si bar ($\mathcal{Y}$) as follows:
%
\be
\varepsilon_d = \frac{\|\mathcal{Y}(\bm{\eta}) - \tilde{\mathcal{Y}}(\bm{\eta})\|_2}{\|\mathcal{Y}(\bm{\eta})\|_2}
\ee
%
The quantity, $\varepsilon_d$, was estimated to be roughly 0.1. In other words, the error introduced
due to approximating the function, $\mathcal{Y}$ by a surrogate, $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}$ is about 10$\%$.
For many applications, this error might be too large, however, it is reasonable and
potentially acceptable for this problem considering that we are interested in approximating
the variability in thermal conductivity due to uncertainty in the SW
parameters. An exact UQ analysis in a 7-dimensional input space for an application involving
atomistic simulations would be computationally impractical as discussed earlier in
Section~\ref{sec:intro}, and highlighted specifically in Table~\ref{tab:effort}.

Second, a higher level assessment of $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}$ is performed wherein
the first-order and second-order 
statistics as well as probability distributions, obtained using the
surrogate and the set of available model evaluations at 35 samples in the 7-dimensional
input space are compared. Table~\ref{tab:verify} provides estimates of the
mean and the standard deviation of bulk thermal conductivity based on the model and the
surrogate. 
%

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
$\textbf{Distribution}$ & $\mu$ & $\sigma$ \\ 
\bottomrule
$G$~(Model) & 13.764 & 3.573 \\
$\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}$ (1D Surrogate) & 13.757 & 3.441 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) corresponding to
the model evaluations ($G$) and surrogate predictions ($\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}$)
at 35 samples in the cross-validation set.}
\label{tab:verify}
\end{table}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:level2} illustrates a comparison of a histogram based on the 35 model evaluations
and a probability density function (PDF), generated using kernel density estimation (KDE)
of surrogate predictions at 10$^5$ Monte Carlo samples in the 7-dimensional input domain.

\caption{A illustrative comparison of the histogram plot based on the
available set of 35 model evaluations and a PDF generated using surrogate predictions at 10$^5$
random samples in the 7-dimensional input domain.}  
\label{fig:level2}
\end{figure}
%
From the values reported in Table~\ref{tab:verify}, it can be said that the
 first-order ($\mu$) and second-order ($\sigma$) statistics of the bulk thermal conductivity ($\kappa$),
obtained using the model and the surrogate  are found to be in close agreement. Additionally, the
comparison of distributions in Figure~\ref{fig:level2} confirms that the PDF captures the modal
estimate as well as the spread in $\kappa$ with reasonable accuracy. Hence, the surrogate based on
the 1-dimensional active subspace, evaluated earlier in~\ref{sub:cas} can be used to quantify and
characterize the uncertainty in bulk thermal conductivity of the Si bar due to the uncertainty in the
SW potential parameters. In the following section, we use the surrogate to estimate the total Sobol'
sensitivity indices of the SW parameters. Additionally, we perform a consistency check by comparing
these estimates with the normalized activity scores, computed using the converged 1-dimensional
active subspace. 

\subsection{Global Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{sub:gsa}

The surrogate $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}(\vec{\eta})$ was used to estimate the total Sobol index, $T_i(G)$ for each
uncertain parameter by mapping 10$^5$ independent Monte Carlo samples in the physical domain
to the bulk thermal conductivity of the Si bar as discussed earlier in~\ref{subsub:gsa_surr}. 
Additionally, normalized activity scores ($\nu_{i,p}$) were computed using~\eqref{eq:ac} and~\eqref{eq:nac}.
A bar-graph comparing estimates of $T_i(G)$ and $\nu_{i,p}$ is provided in
Figure~\ref{fig:gsa}. 
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./Figures/free_as_gsa}
\caption{A comparative assessment of the Sobol total-effect index, $\mathcal{T}(\theta_i)$, and the normalized
activity scores, $\tilde{\nu}_{i,p}$, for GSA of the SW potential parameters.}
\label{fig:gsa}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
The sensitivity estimates based on the two approaches are found to be consistent. This is expected since
both, the surrogate and the dominant eigenvectors are associated with the active subspace. Moreover, it
was shown in~\cite{Vohra:2018c} that the activity scores can be used to approximate the bounds on Sobol
total-effect indices. The above result indicates that the variability in bulk thermal conductivity is predominantly
due to the uncertainty in $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\gamma$. This is also consistent with our earlier
findings involving GSA using DGSMs~\cite{Vohra:2018b}~(see Figure~7 therein). While we have focused on uncertainty
propagation in this work, this result could be exploited to reduce computational effort associated with
calibration of the SW parameters. Specifically, it seems pragmatic to allocate bulk of the computational
resources for calibrating the important parameters: $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\gamma$.
